description: |
  This document defines device tree properties common to reset
  controller devices that perform assert/deassert by simply
  toggling bit.

  All devices in this binding should satisfy the following requirement:
  - There is a single, contiguous range of 32-bit registers.
  - All bits in each register directly control a reset line.
     - There are no self-deasserting resets.
     - There are no timing requirements.
     - The bits are exclusively resets, nothing else.
  - All bits behave the same, so all reset bits are either
    active-high or all are active-low.
  - The bits can be read back, but the read status may
    be active-low independently from the writes.

  If the device is not meet the requirement, it should use its
  own binding to describe the device.

properties:
  compatible:
    const: reset-simple

  reg:
    maxItems: 1

  "#reset-cells":
    const: 1

  active-low:
    type: boolean
    description:
      If true, bits are cleared to assert the reset. Otherwise,
      bits are set to assert the reset. This also applies to
      read back.

required:
  - compatible
  - reg
  - "#reset-cells"

additionalProperties: false

examples:
  - |
    reset-controller@1000000 {
        compatible = "reset-simple";
        reg = <0x1000000 0x1000>;
        #reset-cells = <1>;
    };
